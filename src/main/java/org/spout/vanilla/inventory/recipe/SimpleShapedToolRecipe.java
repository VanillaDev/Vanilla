	 * Constructs a tool recipe given a few constrains. It can have only two materials within the recipe (namely one major and one minor material). This recipe should only be used
	 * for recipes such as a Wooden Sword or a Wooden Pickaxe; both which have a 3x3 crafting recipe that have a major (plank) and minor (stick) material with everything else in
	 * the matrix as null.
	 * <p/>
	 * Example:
	 * ---------------------
	 * | Plank Plank Plank |
	 * | Null  Stick Null  |
	 * | Null  Stick Null  |
	 * ---------------------
	 * @param instance        Instance of our plugin
	 * @param craftingEnabler The controller that would "manage" this recipe. Example would be CraftingController or VanillaPlayer (as part of their inventory would be a crafting matrix).
	 * @param name            Name of the recipe
	 * @param major           The main ingredient of the recipe
	 * @param minor           The minor ingredient of the recipe
	 * @param majorC          Character represents major ingredient
	 * @param minorC          Character represents minor ingredient
	 * @param emptyC          Character represents empty crafting matrix slot
	 * @param result          The resulting item stack
	 * @param rows            The rows that should be registered for the recipe. This can be any amount (variable).
